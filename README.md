# Landing Page Project made by Mohamed Ragab

i hope my project  to be accepted ( 1 th project)

i linked navbar to sections in the page 
after creating elements using DOM in JavaScript


I created a function to create a link for each section,
and i created button to create new sections
with each click

also i  made a button  to go up in the page 


I made the link header disappear after 8 seconds and reappear with just a scroll.
